# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-09
Feature: file-based-persistence

## Codebase Patterns
- Vertical slice architecture with handler/operations separation
- Structured logging with event naming: {domain}.{action}.{state}
- Feature-specific error types using thiserror
- Pure business logic in operations.rs, I/O in handler.rs

## Key Files
- src/sessions/handler.rs - Session I/O orchestration
- src/sessions/operations.rs - Pure session business logic
- src/sessions/types.rs - Session data structures
- src/core/config.rs - Application configuration

## 2026-01-09 - US-001
- Implemented session registry directory structure creation
- Files changed: src/core/config.rs, src/sessions/operations.rs, src/sessions/errors.rs, src/sessions/handler.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Added sessions_dir() method to Config for consistent path management
  - Created ensure_sessions_directory() function with proper error handling
  - Added IoError variant to SessionError enum for filesystem operations
  - Directory creation is now part of session creation flow
  - Tests verify directory creation works correctly and handles existing directories

## 2026-01-09 - US-002
- Implemented session file persistence with JSON serialization
- Files changed: Cargo.toml, src/sessions/types.rs, src/sessions/operations.rs, src/sessions/handler.rs
- **Learnings:**
  - Added serde and serde_json dependencies for JSON serialization
  - Made Session and SessionStatus structs serializable with #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
  - Implemented atomic file writes using temp file + rename pattern to prevent corruption
  - Session ID with "/" is converted to "_" for filename compatibility (test/branch -> test_branch.json)
  - File save is integrated into create_session flow after worktree creation but before completion
  - Tests verify both successful serialization and file system operations
