##Core Principles

### Keep it simple 
- Don not over engineer
- Keep it simple
- Keep core code and principles well tested

### YAGNI
-Justify every line of code you write

Keep in mind that we are early on in development and we dont have any users yet so dont be afraid of breaking things, we aslo dont need complicated backwards compatibility. Since we are building coer primitives first.
